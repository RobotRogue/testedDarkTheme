# Tested.com 'Dark Mode and Embiggen the Videos' Extension

I've gone ahead and written a '_**Resize video player and darken the page css a bit - automatically  for Tested.com**_' Chrome extension!

Why you ask? Well I'm a fan of darker websites since light-themed websites hurt my eyes over time.

The other issue I encountered was I found the Premium Content video player too small, and it really only has 2 sizes: Small, and Fullscreen. Hardly useful for me when I want to play videos while working on other stuff on the same screen.

So out of boredom, an opportunity to learn something, and partly to see if I could do it - I set off to work to make this!

## Manual steps to install once you clone this repo:

1) Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.

2) Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

3) Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

_**Voila! It's now installed!**_

## Installation of the Extension from the Chrome Web Store:

1) Once I pay the money to be able to upload content to the Chrome Web Store, I'll add the steps and links here.

## Notes:

There are a lot of pages I have not touched yet (Login page, signup page, premium signup page, various user/account pages, and the occasional one I likely missed along the way) - I plan to do those in the future, but the bulk of the work is done and I'm satisfied enough to release what I have done so far.

The code isn't the cleanest. This is my first kick at the can and I am sure there are way better ways to handle things. If you have suggestions, open an issue with your suggestions.

If you really want me to fix something, also open an issue.

And lastly, thanks for viewing my work!
