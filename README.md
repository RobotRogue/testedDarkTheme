## Steps to install once you clone this repo:
1) Open the Extension Management page by navigating to chrome://extensions.
2) Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3) Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory.

Voila! It's now installed! And you will get to see how horribly I broke the rest of the site. But the video pages will look cool!
