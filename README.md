## Steps to install once you clone this repo:

Voila! It's now installed!

## Notes:
There are a lot of pages I have not touched yet (signup page, permium signup page, various user/account pages, and the occasional one I likely missed along the way) - I plan to do those in the future, but the bulk of the work is done and I'm satisfied enough to release what I have done so far.

The code isn't the cleanest. This is my first kick at the can and I am sure there are way better ways to handle things. If you have suggestions, open an issue with your suggestions.

If you really want me to fix something, also open an issue.

And lastly, thanks for viewing my work!
